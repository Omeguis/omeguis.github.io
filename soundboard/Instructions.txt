This soundboard add-on requires access to the "professional api", which requires a minimum subscription at the Advanced level.

It takes just a couple of steps to set it up.
Unzip the files anywhere on your machine, but make sure you don't rename any files or directories once unzipped
Then go to http://branebot.com/Account/Settings  and then to the Integration tab.  Copy the Integration Token.
Open the token.txt file and paste the token in there.

Now open the settings.txt file and follow the instructions to see where to place your sound files and setup the commands.

Once you're setup, just point your browser source to soundboard.html.
