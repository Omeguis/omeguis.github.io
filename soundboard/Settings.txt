//put your sounds in the sounds directory

//create the commands like you would normally at http://branebot.com/Commands/Current, the command restrictions apply
//for instance, you can make a sub only command using the restrictions in the command settings
//if a user is not a sub, that command does not get passed through the API

//add a line for each command you want to trigger a sound
//the format is
//  command,sound file name, amount of currency the command costs, minimum bits
// minimum bits 0 means bits don't matter
// if using bits, put higher ones first, soundboard will play first one that matches criteria
// you can leave the first paramter empty if you don't want a command

//Remove the lines below or put // in front of them to comment them out when you use this addon
